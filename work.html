          More and more we are turning to be a paperless society and with that we are changing the way we used to do simple things such as reading an actual newspaper or buying a print magazine. We have changed many things to accommodate our daily routines and lifestyle. Now finding information and getting inspired it's just a click away. For our 4th project on Ironhack we were asked to work on a e-Magazine of our choice with the guidance of the profile of the user persona we decide to choose.

            Competitive feature analysis tool helped me to understand where TU ESTILO blue ocean market position was, It wasn’t so hard to recognize where the e-magazine position was. However in order to be positioned in the blue ocean it would required to combine fashion for more realistic woman and inspiring stories.

            I searched and compared the websites and discovered that most of them have the same type of models and stereotypes.The competitors I explored were Vogue and Cosmopolitan.

            Lo-Fidelity wireframes were tested amoung the users with a 100% direct success.

            However, during user testing I found that within the tested users there were 16.7% of mis clicks.

            After the testing of the lo fidelity prototypes I then proceeded to create the mid fidelity wireframes.
